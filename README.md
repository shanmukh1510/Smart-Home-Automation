### 🔹 **Project Title:**

**Smart Home Automation Servo Bot**

---

### 🔹 **Description:**

The **Smart Home Automation Servo Bot** is a system designed to control and automate home appliances using sensors, servo motors, and IoT technology. It allows users to manage devices such as lights, fans, and doors either automatically based on sensor input or manually through a mobile application.

Servo motors perform physical actions like rotating switches, opening doors, or adjusting curtains. The system is built around a **microcontroller** (Arduino or NodeMCU) that receives data from sensors and controls the servos and relays accordingly.

### 🔹 **Key Components:**

1. **Microcontroller (Arduino / NodeMCU)** – Controls all operations.
2. **Servo Motors** – Perform physical movements like turning or lifting.
3. **Relay Module** – Switches on/off electrical appliances.
4. **Sensors:**

   * **PIR Sensor:** Detects human motion for automatic lighting.
   * **Temperature Sensor (DHT11):** Controls fans or coolers based on room temperature.
   * **LDR Sensor:** Turns lights on/off depending on brightness.
5. **Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266 built-in)** – Connects to the mobile app for remote control.
6. **Power Supply (9V or USB)** – Powers the circuit.

### 🔹 **Working Principle:**

* The sensors continuously collect data from the environment.
* When a sensor triggers a condition (e.g., motion detected, low light), the microcontroller sends a signal to the servo or relay.
* The **servo bot** performs a physical action, such as rotating a switch or opening a small door.
* Users can also control the system manually through an **IoT-based mobile app** connected over Wi-Fi.

---

### 🔹 **Applications:**

* Automatic lighting and fan control.
* Smart door and curtain operation.
* Energy-saving home systems.
* Safety and security automation.

---

### 🔹 **Advantages:**

* Reduces manual effort.
* Improves energy efficiency.
* Offers remote monitoring and control.
* Simple and low-cost automation solution.

---

### 🔹 **Conclusion:**

The **Smart Home Automation Servo Bot** shows how sensors, IoT, and servo motors can work together to make homes smarter and more efficient. It replaces manual switches with automated operations and provides convenience and safety through simple smart control.
